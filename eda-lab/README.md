# 🌐 EDA Lab

> **Hands-on Nokia EDA Workshop**

Welcome to the SGNOG12 EDA Lab!   
This workshop provides **three comprehensive guides** to help you master Nokia's Event-Driven Automation (EDA) platform through practical, hands-on exercises.

## 📚 Workshop Structure

This lab is divided into three progressive parts:

### 🏗️ [Part 1: Fabric Intent Creation & Verification](part1-fabric-intent.md)

Learn how to create and verify an CLOS leaf-spine underlay IP fabric using EDA intents.

**What you'll learn:**
- Creating fabric intents with proper selectors and allocation pools
- Using dry-run to preview configuration changes
- Verifying fabric health and status
- Validating configurations on SR Linux devices

**Duration:** ~45 minutes

---

### 🔄 [Part 2: Service Overlays](part2-service-overlays.md)

Build on your fabric foundation by implementing service overlays.

**What you'll learn:**
- Configuring EVPN-VXLAN overlays
- Creating Layer 2 service
- Service verification and troubleshooting

**Duration:** ~60 minutes

---

### 🔍 [Part 3: Deviations & EQL (EDA Query Language)](part3-deviations-eql.md)

Master advanced EDA capabilities for monitoring and querying your network state.

**What you'll learn:**
- Understanding and managing configuration deviations
- Writing EQL queries to extract network insights
- Automating compliance checks

**Duration:** ~45 minutes

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, ensure you have:

- An operational **Nokia EDA environment** with GUI access
- A discovered/imported topology (leaf-spine architecture)
- Pre-created **allocation pools**:
  - System IPs (IPv4)
  - Inter-switch link IPs (/31 pools)
  - ASN pool for BGP
- **Labels** configured on:
  - Leaf nodes (`eda.nokia.com/role=leaf`)
  - Spine nodes (`eda.nokia.com/role=spine`)
  - Inter-switch links (`eda.nokia.com/role=interSwitch`)
- SSH access to SR Linux devices for verification
- Basic understanding of:
  - IP networking and BGP
  - EVPN-VXLAN concepts (for Part 2)
  - Network automation principles

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Recommended path:** Complete the parts in sequence, as each builds on concepts from the previous section.

1. **Start here:** [Part 1: Fabric Intent Creation & Verification](part1-fabric-intent.md)
2. **Continue with:** [Part 2: Service Overlays](part2-service-overlays.md)
3. **Finish with:** [Part 3: Deviations & EQL](part3-deviations-eql.md)

> **💡 Tip:** Each guide includes troubleshooting sections and verification steps. Don't skip the verification—it's crucial for understanding!
